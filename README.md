## Math is Cool, and So Are Computers

So now you know what I am interested in.
I am passionate about 
- languages (computer and natural). Especially patterns of comminication that transcend languages
- physics. The way nature comminucates with us
- people. A while back my big bro Zaydok told me that people are the most valuable resource on Earth
